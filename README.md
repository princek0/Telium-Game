Telium Game (Unfinished) 24/05/21
============
- This is a project for school so I was limited when using libraries since the computers at school did not allow me to install other libraries. 
- It's a text-based adventure game. 
- There are instructions when you start the game.
- I focused a lot on efficiency (you can see this in the comments.)
- Enjoy!

<b>Libraries used:</b>
- random
- turtle
- time
- csv
